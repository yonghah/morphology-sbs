The style is inspired by Allen Jacobs' ["Great Streets"](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Streets-Press-Allan-Jacobs/dp/0262600234) and [Geoff Boeing's Jupyter Notebook](http://geoffboeing.com/2017/01/).

- The map is styled and rendered using [Mapbox-gl.js] (https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/).
- A city's location is found with its name using [Nominatim] (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim).
